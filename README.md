# Economic Data Social Analysis

The purpose of this project is to analyze statistics relevant to the United States and its demographics, with the hope of being able to visualize these discrepancies. While perhaps an unusual approach, this project intends on focusing on people of color and generating Empathy through numbers and data. This project will go through various factors within society such as Education, Work and Policy Brutality. While there is much more research to be done, it is my hope that through this project I can shed light just on how disproportionate we as a society have begun, and how change must begin urgently.

The data was collected through https://www.census.gov/data/developers.html
